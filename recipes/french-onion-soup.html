        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A traditional French meal cooked with caramelised onions and beef stock or broth. It is called soupe à l'oignon gratinée in French. Bread and cheese are added to the soup, which is then gratinéed to a thick, oozy perfection. Traditionally, it is served in a handle-equipped ceramic crock or ramekin.</p>
        <p>Gruyère cheese is typically used to top French onion soup, but other cheeses can also be used. To achieve maximum richness, most French onion soups are topped with three cheeses.</p>
